How this would work:
Use Python as a backend, using the FastAPI library. Python will also be used to handle saving information to database, and keeping a server for the Web Interface.
HTML will be used as an interface, possible CSS as well (if I'm not lazy), and JavaScript will be used to handle buttons and make requests to the local server.
